###Hand-Tracker-Model

##Overview

Hand-Tracker-Model is a real-time hand tracking system built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This project enables efficient detection and tracking of hand landmarks, making it useful for gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, and various interactive applications.

##Features

-Real-time hand tracking

-21-point hand landmark detection

-Lightweight and efficient

-Easy integration with other projects

##How It Works

1. Captures video frames using OpenCV.

2. Uses MediaPipe's Hand Tracking solution to detect hands in real-time.

3. Draws landmarks on detected hands for visualization.

4. Outputs the processed video stream with hand tracking enabled.
